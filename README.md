Welcome to the pseudo-package manger from Hell. I wrote this because I got bored and decided to do so for the shites and giggles.

1.0: installation

First, use git clone https://github.com/kantiankant/gitfetch.git to clone the repository to your machine. Next, change your working directory to gitfetch/ using the cd gitfetch/ command. Now run the ./install.sh script and it should automatically install on your machine. 

1.2: usage

-s is search. Example: gitfetch -s lazyvim

-c is clone. Example: gitfetch -c DreaMaoMao/mangowc

-h is help. Example: gitfetch -h

-l is list. It lists the stuff you installed using this tool

1.3: Roadmap/To-Add

* Support for sh
* General security improvements for gitfetch (This never ends)
*  An update script so you don't have to pull and run the install script manually

1.4: How to update gitfetch

Simply run the given update script (./update.sh) and you should be done

This was inspired by a friend's project, go check his stuff out at: NyAncQt/ghpm
